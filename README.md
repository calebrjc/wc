# wc

A skeleton for a project that involves the implementation of a simplified version of the Unix "wc"
tool, inspired by and improved from a project template from my OS class at UGA.

This repository provides skeleton code for the project detailed in the write-up found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5yrzbJL63651f7ZAWmmoArvcE2VWaaVvTdhXot72AA/edit?usp=sharing).

Feel free to use this project for any class, or to work on it yourself for practice programming in
C. All that I ask for in return, along with following the instructions outlined in this repository's
license, is some form of attribution that credits me as the original author of this code.

Thanks in advance!
